## UX

### User Stories

1. As a user, I would be looking for details on the Ballet school, its history, are the teachers qualified?
2. As a user, I want to get details of where to buy the uniforms and what I would need.
3. As a user, To be able to find the schedule of the classes and the studios quickly.
4. As a user, I would like to know if they are Covid-19 conscious and what prescautions have been taken.

### Strategy

A mulity layout, simple yet elegant and containing images that would inspire the young dancers inner ballerina.
In having a clean, easy to read and navigate website it would instill parental confidence in the school and allow them a sense of sercurity. They would feel their child would be well looked after.

### Scope

To show all the information in a clean and precise way, I decided to split up the website into pages. Each page is dedicated to a different aspect of the school. The market research and user stories showed me the top 5 things that had to be displayed.

### Structure

**Welcome page**
This is the first thing they would see. In this page, I wanted to give a general overall feed for the site, Elegant and simple with a direct link to the enrollment form and the benfists of doing Ballet.

**Teachers Section**
Here you will be able to read the teachers bios. There is also a history section on it,is a brief history of the school.

**Location Section**
Has a list of the studios the physical address and a button that links to a Google maps page that gives a pin if they need direction.

**Schedule Section**
This page has an easy to read table with the different classes and times at each studio.
I added a download schedule pdf.

**Enrollment Section**
The emrolment form sends all the details to the teachers using EmaliJS. There is a auto replay to the student to conferm that they have read and agreed with the Terms and Conditions of the school. The teachers will get a email and respond acordinly.

**Attire Section**
Ballet is an art-form with a set uniform for male and female, everything from hair to shoes has a strict rule on how and what to wear. This page gives an overview on how to tie hair (With Video) and where to go for the approriateforms — links to Outlets and videos on "how-to's".

**Covid-19**
Containing all the Covid safety regulations for the ballet school.

### Surface

#### Fonts

- [Exo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2?query=Exo) - Primary Font: It is clear and easy to read and gives a moden feel. I use this for the main body of the page.
- [Italianno](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Italianno?query=Italianno) - Secondary Font: "Italianno is an elegant calligraphic script with clean connectors and classic forms. Perfect for warm, inviting situations."

#### Colours and Images

Each pages has its own colour scheme and image.
The whole page background image were chosen for there grace and elegance. They were chosen to inspire and instil the desire for the inner ballerina.

## Testing

Reading the user stories, gave me a good insight as to where and what the site needed to be and what to show,

- In the Teachers section, you will be able to find information on the teachers and their qualifications and also a brief description of the history of the school.
- On the Attire page is a description of the clothes (uniforms) that are needed and links to outlets/shops on a Google maps page. Here they can get directions to the physical address and webpages.
- In the Locations page there are addresses and Google Maps links to the studios. On the Schedule page there is a detailed table with Location Grade and Times, with a downloadable PDF

I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to make the site which has an extention called "Live Server by ritwickdey.liveserver", this enabled me open an instance of Chrome to see live updates on what changes I have made. When I make a change to a design element, I then a look in the Developer tool that is provided to see how it works on different screen sizes and resolutions.

I used GitHub web hosting service called Gitpages to host an instance of the page, I then went through all the pages and links in the Nav Bar and footer to make sure they work, and make sure my `target="_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"`- is working as planned.

I do this for every page, and I use the different browsers, Chrome, FireFox, Windows Edge, Safari. In each browser, I try to break the layout. In Chrome and FireFox, I make use of the preset they have for mobile/tablets. On the other browsers, I resize the window manually to see their response.

I also viewed it on different mobile phone types to see how it worked.

- iPhone 4 / 6 / 8
- Samsung J5 / A5
- Sony Xperia 10
- Mi A3

The next stage of testing was external testing. I sent the code and the webpage into peer-to-peer code testing in Code Institute section on Slack.

### Bugs

I found a bug in the footer section on the page. On pages that had less information and used less real state, the footer kept on creeping up, and on some devices, the page length was not filling the entire screen. I reached out to the Slack community and was pointed in the right direction. After a little figgering out I what able to fix it.

> The fix was relatively easy, the reason it was creeping up was I hadn't given the browsers the height it was looking for, once I set the height of the HTML and the Body of the page:

```css
html {
  height: 100%;
}
body {
  margin: 0;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

everything sealed down, and the footer stayed at the foot.

Another bug I have is on the landing page, portrait view on a mobile the screen is not scrolling. Looking into this further I fond that the _Landing page (index HTML)_ and the _Contact page_ were not filling the iPad resolutions at all, only half of the page was being utilised.
My fix was to give the to pages a separate class with its own _min-height_ giving the footer _(12vh)_ the rest of the height.

```css
.max-container {
  padding: 20px;
  min-height: 88vh;
}
```

That fix has worked.
